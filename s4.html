The most active thing she does is mother a household full of dwarfs. She never retaliates against the evil queen who tries to kill her for her youth and beauty, she waits for her prince frozen in her glass coffin, as feminist critics have put it, "an object, to be displayed and desired... patriarchy's ideal woman, the perfect candidate for Queen." In an essay entitled "My Stepmother, Myself," Garrison Keillor actually suspects the prince of necrophilia! Yikes! That doesn't sound like one of the best fairy tales for kids.Regardless, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first animated full-length Disney film, launching a hugely successful franchise and setting the pattern for all those to come, with warbling songs, sidekicks for comic relief, and lots of animal helpers (always our favorite part). It was also the first film soundtrack ever to be released separately as an album. Surprisingly "Snow White" revived the evil queen's distinctively Grimm directive to cut out Snow's heart and bring it home in a box. But Disney's queen did escape the original fairy tale punishment of being forced to dance to her death in red-hot shoes. According to Film Site,"[the movie] took almost four years and an astronomical (at the time) $1.7 million to create, and was released for its premiere during the Christmas season of 1937."Since then, we've seen many influential movie retellings: Snow White and the Huntsman, Mirror, Mirror, The Huntsman: Winter's War, and several literary works including Snow, a graphic novel set in 1930s New York City. If you love Disney Princesses, you'll want this collection of magical Disney Princess quotes to live by.</i></p></center>
